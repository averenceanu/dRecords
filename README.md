# dRecords

**Project Description**
An online charting application allowing healthcare providers to access patient information and schedule follow-up appointments efficiently. The user can keep track of old entries and register new ones upon a change in the patient's condition. An integrated calendar allows the user to plan tasks and keep track of upcoming events.

**Problem solved** 
Currently, there are few universal tools that allow for charting, diagnosis, medical history, and appointment all on one platform, which leads to greater effort on practitioner and time consumption. 

As a previous healthcare provider, I believe that to solve the inefficiencies there should be a uniform portal allowing for all of these procedures to happen in one place. 

This projectsâ€™ value proposition is to allow the practitioner to perform all these functions resulting in a greater time savings and convenience, freeing up their time to allow for actual healthcare rather than administrative duties. 


**Target audience:** Healthcare providers looking for an effective way of documenting their diagnosis and notes as well as keeping track of patients.
